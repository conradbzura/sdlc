# SDLC Pipeline for LLM Agents

A structured, human-in-the-loop software development lifecycle pipeline for working with LLM coding assistants. This repo provides a canonical set of skills and guides that enforce discipline, quality, and collaboration throughout the development process, served as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

You're in control. The agent proposes; you approve. No destructive actions happen without your explicit consent.

## Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy

Building software with LLM agents is powerful but risky without structure. Without guardrails, agents make arbitrary choices about commit structure, testing, and code organization. Autonomous workflows can push broken code or submit PRs without review. Code quality becomes unpredictable.

This pipeline attempts to solve that by keeping you in the loop at every decision point. Issues are drafted before they're filed, code is planned before it's written, tests are specified before implementation, commits are atomic with clear messages, and PRs are reviewed before pushing. The goal is to make the agent's work visible and deliberate. This approach balances agent efficiency (structured planning, bulk changes) with human judgment (approval gates, oversight, pivotal decisions).

## Quick Start

Install and run the MCP server. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) can connect.

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sdlc": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/conradbzura/sdlc", "sdlc-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or install locally and point to the entry point:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sdlc": {
      "command": "sdlc-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / JetBrains

Configure your IDE's MCP settings to launch the `sdlc-mcp` command via stdio transport. Refer to your IDE's MCP documentation for the exact configuration format.

### Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conradbzura/sdlc
cd sdlc
pip install -e .
```

You now have seven tools available: `sdlc_issue`, `sdlc_implement`, `sdlc_test`, `sdlc_commit`, `sdlc_pr`, `sdlc_review`, `sdlc_understand_chat`.

### End-to-End Example

Here's what a complete workflow looks like from idea to merged code.

**1. File an Issue**

You discuss a problem or describe the work you want done:

```
I want to add retry logic to the API client. It should retry on 5xx errors, with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts.
```

The agent calls the `sdlc_issue` tool, drafts the issue, you review it, and it gets filed. You get an issue number: #42.

If you have issue templates defined in your `.github` dir, the agent will follow the relevant template.

**2. Implement the Feature**

The agent calls `sdlc_implement` with issue number 42. It fetches the issue, creates a branch (`42-add-api-client-retry-logic`), gathers codebase context, enters planning mode with a concrete implementation plan, and waits. You review the plan, approve it, and the code and tests are implemented according to what you approved.

**3. (Optional) Write Additional Tests**

If you want more comprehensive test coverage, the agent calls `sdlc_test` with issue number 42. It analyzes what changed in the branch, reads existing tests to avoid duplication, proposes new test cases, and waits for your approval. You review and approve, and new tests are added.

**4. Commit with Atomic, Well-Described Commits**

When you're satisfied with the code, the agent calls `sdlc_commit`. It analyzes the working tree diff, groups changes by logical kind (refactors, new features, tests, etc.), and presents a plan for how it will commit. You review the plan, approve it, and commits are created with conventional-commit messages.

**5. Create a Draft PR**

The agent calls `sdlc_pr` with issue number 42. It reviews the branch diff against main, drafts a PR description based on what was actually implemented, and creates a draft PR — never auto-marked ready for review. You review the description, approve it, and the PR is pushed.

If you have a PR template defined in your `.github` dir, the agent will follow that template.

**6. Review the PR (Optional)**

The agent calls `sdlc_review` with the PR number. It runs one or more reviewer roles (N reviewers per role) over the PR diff, each confined to the files its role is mapped to, then consolidates their findings — deduped, merged across roles, highest severity wins — into a single local document at `.sdlc/reviews/issue-#<N>/review-<iteration>.md`. The document groups findings by severity (blocking first), gives each a stable ID and a `Reference`, and pre-selects a recommended remediation per finding with alternatives and an `Other` slot. You review and approve the document; nothing is posted to GitHub. The document is a local artifact you (or the agent) read to drive fixups manually — `sdlc_implement` does not ingest it, so address the findings directly using each one's pre-selected remediation and fixup-mapping entry as the work list.

**7. Iterate or Merge**

If review feedback requires changes, re-enter the implementation loop with `sdlc_implement`. Address the feedback, then re-run test, commit, and pr tools as needed. When you're satisfied, mark the PR ready for review and merge via GitHub.

## What You Get

The pipeline enforces disciplined commits — atomic, well-structured, with conventional-commit messages that make your history readable. It emphasizes test-first planning, generating comprehensive test specs before implementation. Code quality is enforced through guide-based, role-driven review that produces a consolidated local review document — an actionable, option-per-finding remediation plan you keep under `.sdlc/reviews/`. Every action is presented for review before execution, so you never have unwanted surprises. When you get PR feedback, you loop back to implementation, refine, and iterate. The system is tool-agnostic — any MCP-compatible client can connect. For large codebases, you can generate lightweight knowledge graphs to give the agent architectural context without shipping megabytes of source code as context.

## Pipeline at a Glance

```
issue → implement → [test] → commit → pr → [review [→ implement → ...]]
```

The optional steps are in brackets. The `implement`, `test`, and `commit` steps are iterative — you can cycle through them as many times as needed before the PR goes out.
